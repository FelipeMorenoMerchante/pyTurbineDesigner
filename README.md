# pyTurbineDesigner
pyTurbineDesigner is an open-source graphical user-interface (GUI) developed in Python using PyQt libraries. pyTurbineDesigner allows the users to analyze and design offshore floating wind turbines and propeller structures. The GUI integrates APIs for 3D parametric geometry and meshing libraries, multi-physics solver kernels including aero-dynamics, structural-dynamics, hydro-dynamics, mooring-dynamics, and control algorithms. The multi-physics solver integrates low-fidelity, high-fidelity and hybrid models. The design feature is enabled through incorporating APIs for optimization algorithms to perform nonlinear gradient-based optimization.
